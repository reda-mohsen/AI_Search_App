# AI Search Application

This application implements various search algorithms to find the optimal path between a start node and a goal node in a graph. The search algorithms implemented in this application include:
* Breadth-First Search (BFS)
* Depth-First Search (DFS)
* Uniform-Cost Search (UCS)
* Greedy Best-First Search
* A* Search Algorithm
